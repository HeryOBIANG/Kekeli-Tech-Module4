As a customer of our {currentProduct} offering we are excited to tell you about a new financial product that would dramatically increase your return.

Currently, you own {currentShares:N2} shares at a return of {currentReturn:P2}.

Our new product, {newProduct} offers a return of {newReturn:P2}.  Given your current volume, your potential profit would be {newProfit:C}.

Here's a quick comparison:

{currentProduct}         {currentReturn:P2}   {currentProfit:C}      
{newProduct}     {newReturn:P2}   {newProfit:C}  ";
